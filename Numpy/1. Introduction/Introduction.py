import numpy as np

#the fundamental library needed for scientific computing with python is called numpy
#numpy is a python library for array oriented computing
#this open sorce library contiains:
                    #a powerful n dimensional array object
                    #advanced array silcing mehods
                    #convenient array reshaping methods



#numpy is good for:
        #image processing
        #signal processing
        #linear algebra
        #etc.

#munpy does numerical computations veri fast....for 1000x1000 matrix in python takes > 10 minutes
                                                                    #with numpy 0.03 secondsS
